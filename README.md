# Blog-Post: Let's talk Web Accessibility
### The Who, What, When, Where, and Why

## What is Web Accessibility ??
Let's first discuss the basics of Web Accessibility and why the discussion of it continues to grow. The plain answer is that all internet content should be displayed in a way that allows everybody to be able to access and consume the content to put it to work. When web designers/developers use Web Accessibility guidelines and best practices, it increases everybody's ability to access important information needed to manage their daily activities.

Problems start when people using assistive technology are not able to use their equipment to get the expected results. That assistive equipment includes screen readers, special keyboards, mouth stick, head wand, single-switch access, sip and puff switch, oversized trackball mouse, special keyboards, eye-tracking, voice recognition software, etc.

Those companies are also vunerble to the ADA's Web Accessibility lawsuits. They can also lose signicant money. A UK study (Click-Away Pound Survey 2016) of 2000+ people states that 71% of users with disabilities said they chose to abandon difficult-to-use websites!

This is the 1st blog post i am writing for an ongoing blog series called: "Let's talk Web Accessibility". This series is designed to be an investigative report and a brief tutorial about the evolving industry of web and apps accessibility. I inten to show that improving Web Accessibility improves use of the internet for all 7 billion people. Content that is digitally accessibile is currently being regulated by laws in many countries as the legal issues increase. Coincidentally, our audience of handicapped and disabled people includes a market of over 1 billion people, with over 6 trillion dollars in spending power ... ok ... hello ... did i just get your attention ??

This blog post is my first article, of many to come, which will document the progress of the who, what, where, why and when this huge unprecedented problem will be resolved ..... or not resolved! This blog series is my way of addressing a new and growing problem inside the old "information-digital-divide". This series is my humble attempt to become somewhat of an authority on an issue that sincerely humbles me.

## ACCESSIBILITY:
I used accessibility code to increase this page's web accessibility. I mostly 
used aria-role landmarks and tabindex code to increase focus and access. There 
is a strong movement in the web development world to build and code web content 
that is accessible to everybody. Lawsuits and accessility standards are happenning 
regularly. Some statistics report there are over 1 billion people worldwide who 
have difficulties using web content because of different disabilities.
