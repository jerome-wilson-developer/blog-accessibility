## ACCESSIBILITY:
I used accessibility code to increase this page's web accessibility. I mostly 
used aria-role landmarks and tabindex code to increase focus and access. There 
is a strong movement in the web development world to build and code web content 
that is accessible to everybody. Lawsuits and accessility standards are happenning 
regularly. Some statistics report there are over 1 billion people worldwide who 
have difficulties using web content because of different disabilities.
