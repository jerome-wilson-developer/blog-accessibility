                Let's first explain the basics of what it is and why the discussion of it continues to grow. The plain answer is that all internet content should be displayed in a way that allows everybody to be able to access the content, and then to be able to put the content to use. The guidelines and the best practices of "Web Accessibility" resources available for software designers increases everyone's ability to have access to important information and critical data needed to manage their day to day activities.

            <p>A huge amount of the content on the web is critical information and vital data to people's everyday lives! Examples: maps for accurate directions, food delivery orders for groceries, online doctor appointments, online clothing stores (sizes, colors, etc), pharmacies correctly filling an online prescription order, buying cars online, difficulties paying online bills and credit card payments, and the list goes on and on. In today's world, you may be retrieving your data from a laptop, a smartphone, tablet, your watch, your clothes, or your desktop computer. Regardless, you are still tapping into that same streaming fountain of life-sustaining information that everybody has to be able to access in order to drink from it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now ... imagine if you should suddenly start having physical, cognitive, hearing, motor skills, or vision difficulties retrieving your daily doses of information to complete your normal daily activities. Today, we are in new waters with aids like screen readers and other assistive technologies being created to assist people with handicaps and disabilities to access and use that important information and data. Unfortunately, many people are not able to physically search and retrieve the content because of the way the software program's code has been written and structured.
            </p>
            <p class="para-last">
            The above reasons (among many others) are why this discussion continues to get louder and louder, and, continues to grow in importance and urgency.

            Some of the <span><a href="#">physical and mental disabilities</a></span> that people live with are legal blindness (braille assistive technologies), sign language (two-way screen video chat), deaf/hearing impaired (captions), mental cognitive disabilities (media sound/speed controls), impaired vision (increase/decrease font and screen sizes), and, access to other helpful media found in the form of print, visual, and audio aids.

            Most of us socialize around people everyday who live their life with handicaps or disabilities. We recognize those individuals and understand the challenges they are dealing with. However, many people who do not fit the common stereotypes of "handicapped or disabiled" still suffer <span><a href="#">internet access difficuties</a></span>. Those people are handicapped because of physical injuries (accidents, slip & falls, etc), mental injuries (concussions, aggravated assaults, etc), illnesses, diseases, car accidents (serious bodily damage), strokes, heart attacks, arthritis, wrist/hand/arm impairments, visual or audio injuries, etc.

            Its a Brave New World out here folks! In a split second, anything can happen to any one of us, at any time, to disable or handicap your ability to access vital and critical web content. As you may be beginning to see ... we are all in this "internet thingy" together, and "equal access" to critical, vital, and life-sustaining information effects everybody equally. What effects your ability to access information equally effects mine!

            This is the 1st blog post i am writing for an ongoing blog series called: "Let's talk Web Accessibility". This series is designed to be an investigative report and a brief tutorial about the evolving industry of web and apps accessibility. Incidentally, our audience of handicapped and disabled people includes a market of over 1 billion people, with over 6 trillion dollars in spending power. ok ... hello ... did i just get your attention ??

            This blog post is my first article, of many to come, which will document the progress of the who, what, where, why and when this huge unprecedented problem will be resolved ..... or not resolved!

This series is my humble attempt to become somewhat of an authority on an issue that sincerely humbles me.

            Lawsuit filings are rapidly increasing because much information and data on the web is actually life-sustaining and vital to the daily maintence of people's lives. Beyonce was <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/04/beyonce-parkwood-entertainment-sued-over-website-accessibility">recently sued over her website</a></span> because it alledgedly violated ADA regulations.

In 2018, there were over 1000 lawsuits filed related to web accessibility, according to the <span><a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/2018s-flood-of-accessibility-lawsuits">BOIA.org</a></span>.

            Some of the industries being sued include clothing and apparel, telecommunications, restaurants, consumer goods, and e-commerce. Some blame the US Department of Justice for lack of clear guidelines on web access compliance. The US <span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/enforcing-ada">DOJ is responsible for compliance</a></span>.

            A mind-boggling paradox for this entire issue of lack of sufficient web accessibility is the business case some are making that supports improving web accessibility. The narrative for that business case says it is estimated that 1 billion people with various disabilities and handicaps ironically represent over <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/">6 trillion dollars</a></span> in spending power. That narrative, if true, is a huge deal-breaker for any company, large or small, who is ignoring or sitting on the sidelines of this problem.

            This is a window of opportunity for some companies, corporations, government agencies, and global ngo's to eliminate this "lack of web access problem".
