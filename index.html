        <h2>What is Web Accessibility ??</h2>
        <p class="para-title">In plain english ...</p>
            <p>
            Let's first explain the basics of what it is and why it keeps being discussed. Web Accessibility increases everyone's ability to have access to important information and critical data needed to manage their day to day activities. 
            </p>
            <p class="para-last">
            The plain and simple answer is that all internet content should be displayed in a way that allows everybody to use it. A huge amount of the content on the web is critical and vital to people's everyday lives! In today's world, the internet is a fountain of vital and life-sustaining information that everybody drinks from. 
            </p>


            

                        
            <h2>Why is Web Accessibility Important ??</h2>
            <p class="para-title">In plain english ...</p>
                <img src="/images/TN-W3C-WAI-311x162.jpg"
              width="35%" height="50%" 
              alt="TN-W3C-WAI-311x162"/>
            <p>Unfortunately, many people are not able to physically search and retrieve content because of the way the software programs have been coded and built. 
            </p>
            <p class="para-last">
            Today, we are in new waters with aids like screen readers and other assistive technologies.
            </p>





            
            <h2>Who is effected by Web Accessibility ??</h2>
            <p class="para-title">In plain english ...</p>
            <div>
                <img src="/images/FOUR-DIABILITIES-1000X260.png"
              width="" height="" alt="4 images of disabilities"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Some of the <span><a href="#">physical and mental disabilities</a></span> that people live with are blindness/braille, sign language, deaf/hearing impaired, mental cognitive disabilities, and media that is difficult to access found in the form of print, visual, and audio .
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of us socialize around people everyday who live with handicaps or disabilities. However, many people who do not fit the common stereotypes of "handicapped or disabiled" still suffer <span><a href="#">internet access difficuties</a></span>. Those people are handicapped because of physical injuries, mental injuries (concussions, etc), illnesses, car accidents, strokes, heart attacks, diseases, arthritis, wrist/hand/arm impairments, visual or audio injuries, etc.
                </p>
                <p class="para-last">
                    Its a Brave New World out here folks! In a split second, anything can happen to any of you, at any time to disable or handicap your ability to access vital and critical web content. As you may be beginning to see ... we are all in this "internet thingy" together. What effects you effects me!

            <p>
            This is the 1st blog post i am writing for an ongoing blog series called: "Let's talk Web Accessibility". This series is designed to be an investigative report and a brief tutorial about the evolving industry of web and apps accessibility. It includes a market of over 1 billion people, with over 6 trillion dollars in spending power. ok ... hello ... did i just get your attention ??
            </p>
            <p class="para-last">
            This blog post is my first article, of many to come, which will document the progress of the who, what, where, why and when this huge unprecedented problem will be resolved ..... or not resolved! This blog series is my way of addressing a new and growing problem inside the old "information-digital-divide". This series is my humble attempt to become somewhat of an authority on an issue that sincerely humbles me.

            <p class="first-para">
                Lawsuit filings are rapidly increasing because much information and data on the web is actually life-sustaining and vital to the daily maintence of people's lives. Beyonce was <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/04/beyonce-parkwood-entertainment-sued-over-website-accessibility">recently sued over her website</a></span> because it alledgedly violated ADA regulations. It seems nowadays that information and data is so important, by so many people, that accessibility lawsuits are becoming more commonplace in the corporate world. In 2018, there were over 1000 lawsuits filed related to web accessibility, according to the <span><a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/2018s-flood-of-accessibility-lawsuits">BOIA.org</a></span>.
            </p>
            <p class="para-last">
                Some of the industries being sued include clothing and apparel, telecommunications, restaurants, consumer goods, and e-commerce. Some blame the US Department of Justice for lack of clear guidelines on web access compliance. The US <span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/enforcing-ada">DOJ is responsible for compliance</a></span>. The DOJ is responsible for compliance of the Americans with Disabilities Act signed into law on July 26, 1990, by then President George HW Bush.

            <p class="first-para">
                A mind-boggling paradox for this entire issue of lack of sufficient web accessibility is the business case some are making that supports improving web accessibility. The narrative for that business case says it is estimated that 1 billion people with various disabilities and handicaps ironically represent over <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/">6 trillion dollars</a></span> in spending power. That narrative, if true, is a huge deal-breaker for any company, large or small, who is ignoring or sitting on the sidelines of this problem.

            <p class="para-la">
                This is a window of opportunity for some companies, corporations, government agencies, and global ngo's to eliminate this "lack of web access problem". In turn, the winners and problem solvers will acquire many life-long loyal customers who appreciate that you solved a "very good problem" by enabling them to release $6 trillion dollars of spending power.
