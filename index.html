            <p>
                Let's first discuss the basics of Web Accessibility and why the discussion of it continues to grow. The plain answer is that all internet content should be displayed in a way that allows everybody to be able to access and consume the content to put it to work. When web designers/developers use Web Accessibility guidelines and best practices, it increases everybody's ability to access important information needed to manage their daily activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Problems start when people using assistive technology are not able to use their equipment to get the expected results. That assistive equipment includes screen readers, special keyboards, mouth stick, head wand, single-switch access, sip and puff switch, oversized trackball mouse, special keyboards, eye-tracking, voice recognition software, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="para-last">
                Those companies are also vunerble to the ADA's Web Accessibility lawsuits. They can also lose signicant money. A UK study (Click-Away Pound Survey 2016) of 2000+ people states that 71% of users with disabilities said they chose to abandon difficult-to-use websites!

            <p>A huge amount of the content on the web is critical data to people's everyday lives! Examples: maps for accurate directions, food delivery orders for groceries, online doctor appointments, online clothing stores (sizes,
                colors, etc), pharmacies correctly filling an online prescription order, buying cars online, difficulties paying online bills and credit card payments, and the list goes on and on. In today's world, you may be retrieving your data from a laptop, a smartphone, tablet, your watch, your clothes, or your desktop computer. Regardless, you are still tapping into that same streaming fountain of life-sustaining information everybody has to access in order to
                drink from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now ... imagine you suddenly have physical, cognitive, hearing, or vision difficulties retrieving your daily doses of information to complete your normal activities. Today, we are in new waters with aids like screen
                readers and other assistive technologies used to assist the handicapped and disabled to access the internet. However, many people are not able to reasonably search and retrieve the content because the software program's code has Not been written within the WCAG-2's Web Accessibility guidelines and best practices.
            </p>
            <p class="para-last">
                The above reasons (among many others) are why this discussion continues to get louder and louder. It will continue to grow in importance and urgency.

                Some of the obvious <span><a href="#">physical and mental disabilities</a></span> that people live with are legal blindness (braille assistive technologies), sign language (two-way screen video chat), deaf/hearing impaired (captions), mental cognitive disabilities (speed and sound controls), impaired vision (increase-decrease font and screen sizes), and, access to other print, visual, and audio aids.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of us socialize around people everyday who live their life with handicaps and disabilities. We recognize those individuals and understand the challenges they are dealing with. However, many people who do not fit the common stereotypes of "handicapped
                or disabiled" still suffer <span><a href="#">internet access difficuties</a></span>. Those people are handicapped because of physical injuries (accidents, slip & falls, etc), mental injuries (concussions, aggravated assaults,
                etc), illnesses, diseases, car accidents (serious bodily damage), strokes, heart attacks, arthritis, wrist/hand/arm impairments, visual or audio injuries, etc.

                Its a Brave New World out here folks! In a split second, anything can happen to any one of us, at any time, to disable or handicap your ability to access vital and critical web content. As you may be beginning to see ... we are all in this "internet thingy"
                together, and "equal access" to critical, vital, and life-sustaining information effects everybody equally. What effects your ability to access information equally effects mine!

                This is the 1st blog post i am writing for an ongoing blog series called: "Let's talk Web Accessibility". This series is designed to be an investigative report and a brief tutorial about the evolving industry of web and apps accessibility. I inten to show that improving Web Accessibility improves use of the internet for all 7 billion people. Content that is digitally accessibile is currently being regulated by laws in many countries as the legal issues increase. Coincidentally, our audience of handicapped and disabled people includes a market of over 1 billion people, with over 6 trillion dollars in spending power ... ok ... hello ... did i just get your attention ??

                This blog post is my first article, of many to come, which will document the progress of the who, what, where, why and when this huge unprecedented problem will be resolved ..... or not resolved! This blog series is my way of addressing a new and growing problem inside the old "information-digital-divide". This series is my humble attempt to become somewhat of an authority on an issue that sincerely humbles me.

                Lawsuit filings are rapidly increasing because an increasing amount of information and data on the web is actually life-sustaining and vital to the maintence of people's daily lives. Beyonce was <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/04/beyonce-parkwood-entertainment-sued-over-website-accessibility">recently sued over her website</a></span> because it alledgedly violated ADA regulations.

            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the industries being sued include clothing and apparel, telecommunications, restaurants, consumer goods, and e-commerce. Some blame the US Department of Justice for lack of clear guidelines on web access compliance. The US <span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/enforcing-ada">DOJ is responsible for compliance</a></span>.
                The DOJ is responsible for compliance of the Americans with Disabilities Act signed into law on July 26, 1990, by then President George HW Bush.

                Some business cases that have been made for improving Web Accessibility are the financial benefits and new customer growth. That narrative states that the 1 billion+ people worldwide with disabilities and handicaps represent over $6,000,000,000,000.00 (trillion) in spending power. That narrative, if true, is a deal-breaker 



                A mind-boggling paradox for this entire issue of lack of sufficient web accessibility is the business case some are making that supports improving web accessibility. The narrative for that business case says it is estimated that 1 billion people with various disabilities and handicaps ironically represent over <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/">$6,000,000,000,000.00 (trillion)</a></span> in spending power.

            <p>The disabiled, the handicapped, and the 2nd tier of disabled people mentioned above daily encouter barriers when attempting to use the internet for basic services.
