                The plain answer is that all internet content 
                should be displayed in a way that allows everybody 
                to be able to access and consume the content so 
                they can put it to work. When web designers/developers 
                use Web Accessibility guidelines and best practices, 
                it increases everybody's ability to access important 
                information needed to manage their daily activities.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    But first, let us discuss the basics of Web Accessibility and why the discussion of it continues to grow. 
                    Many accessibility problems start for companies when people using assistive technology are not able to work their equipment to get the expected results. Those companies also become vunerble to the ADA's Web Accessibility lawsuits. They can end up losing signicant amounts of money because of customer website abandonment, or, because of Web Accessibiity lawsuits from the customers.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    A recent study of over 2,000 people (<a href="http://www.clickawaypound.com/cap16finalreport.html">Click-Away Pound Survey 2016</a>) was completed in the UK. It summized that 71% of users with disabilities said they chose to abandon difficult-to-use websites! The same survey revealed customers who abandon the difficult-to-access websites represent a spending power of roughly $12,000,000,000.00 (billion) euros. Also, 82% would spend more money if the websites were constructed with better access to their valuable, much needed web content.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    By the way, the assistive technology equipment purchased by many people is not cheap. Can you imagine their frustration not being able to consume web content because of poorly written and designed software code ?? Some of the assistive equipment purchased includes screen readers, special keyboards, mouth stick, head wand, single-switch access, sip and puff switch, oversized trackball mouse, special keyboards, eye-tracking, voice recognition software, etc.
                </li>

                </a></span> 
                that people live with are legal blindness (braille assistive technologies), sign language (two-way screen video chat), deaf/hearing impaired (captions), mental cognitive disabilities (speed and sound controls), impaired vision (increase-decrease font and screen sizes), and, access to other print, visual, and audio media.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most of us socialize around people everyday who live their life with handicaps and disabilities. We recognize those individuals and understand the challenges they are dealing with.</li>
                <li>However, many people who do not fit the common stereotypes of "handicapped or disabled" still suffer <span><a href="https://www.criterion508.com/accessibility?msclkid=bf9c8293549a16f0282adca772af5212&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ACCESS&utm_term=%2Bweb%20%2Baccessibility&utm_content=access-web">internet access difficuties</a></span>. </li>
                <li>Those people are handicapped because of physical injuries (accidents, slip & falls, etc), mental injuries (concussions, aggravated assaults, etc), illnesses, diseases, car accidents (serious bodily damage), strokes, heart attacks, arthritis, wrist/hand/arm impairments, visual or audio injuries, etc.</li>

                Its a Brave New World out here folks! In a split second, anything can happen to any one of us, at any time, to disable or handicap your ability to access vital and critical web content. As you may be beginning to see ... we are all in this "internet thingy" together, and "equal access" to critical, vital, and life-sustaining information effects everybody equally. What effects your ability to access information equally effects my access!

                Imagine you suddenly develop physical, cognitive, hearing, or vision difficulties.
                <br/>Now, how do you retrieve your daily doses of information to complete your daily activities. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    A huge amount of the content on the web is critical data to people's everyday lives! Examples: maps for accurate directions, food delivery orders for groceries, make online doctor appointments, buy online clothing stores (sizes, colors, etc), pharmacies correctly filling an online prescription order, buying cars online, difficulties paying online bills and credit card payments, and the list goes on and on. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                    In today's world, you may be retrieving your data from a laptop, a smartphone, tablet, your watch, your clothes, or your desktop computer. Regardless, you are still tapping into that same streaming fountain of life-sustaining information everybody has to access in order to drink from it.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                    Today, we are in new waters with aids like screen readers and other assistive technologies used to assist the handicapped and disabled to access the internet. However, many people are not able to reasonably search for internet content because the software code has Not been written within the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG-2.0 guidelines</a> and best practices.
                    </p>

                This is the 1st blog post i am writing for an ongoing blog series called: "Let's talk Web Accessibility". This series is designed to be an investigative report and a tutorial about the evolving industry of web and apps accessibility. I intend to show that improving Web Accessibility improves use of the internet for all 7 billion people. Content that is digitally accessibile is currently being regulated by laws in many countries as the legal issues increase. Coincidentally, our audience of handicapped and disabled people includes a market of over 1 billion people, with over $6,000,000,000,000.00 (trillion) dollars in spending power ... ok ... hello ... did i just get your attention ??

                This blog post is my first article of many to come. They will document the progress of the who, what, where, why and when this huge unprecedented problem will be resolved ..... or not resolved! This blog series is my way of addressing "a new and growing problem", which lives inside an "old information-digital-divide problem". This series is my humble attempt to become somewhat of an authority on an issue that sincerely humbles me.

                WebAIM did a survey of homepages for the top 1 million worldwide websites. It is discussed in the <span><a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">WebAIM Million report</a></span>. 97.8% of the home pages had detectable <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0">WCAG-2 failures</a></span>.
                5 of 6 home pages were due to <span><a href="http://wiki.accede-web.com/en/notices/html-css">improper HTML code</a></span> for Accessibility. And to show you how bad the failure indicators really were, the automated tool that was used only detected a small portion of the actual accessibility issues.

                    Other "inadequate and bad code" included missing "alt= tags" to describe images, tabindex=0 to control tab flow by the users and properly navigate the webpages, alt tags with confusing descriptions, proper button and form wai-aria labels, aria-role landmarks to help screen readers and software programs to the roles and purpose of different element's content, skip links to avoid unintelligible code for assistive equipment to decipher, html language tags, the correct and orderly use of header tags (h1 thru h6) to maintain orderly flow of the content for the users, and, avoid the low text-to-background contrast of the color schemes.

            <p>
                If 97.8% of the top 1 million hoe pages in teh WebAIM Million report (Feb2018) failed for basic and fundamental reasons, then i predict Web Accessibiity becoming a peripheral industry around the web design business. Web Accessibiity Support companies will provide support services for coded websites (html, css, javascript, php, python, etc). They will also provide support services for wordpress, drupal, joomla, squrespace, wix, and others affected by ADA and WCAG regulations, laws, guidelines, and best practices. As those best practices and laws evolve, so will the need for continous updates from the support service companies.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe that is why the big guns (Facebook, Microsoft, Stanford, AT&T, LinkedIn, Georgia Tech, Adobe, and others) are coming out and uniting. Web Accessibiity will surely affect their individual profitability, their Goodwill, and their reputation as household names.

        <p>In my humble opinion, the most important lesson from this blog post is that anyone and everyone can encouter serious difficulties consuming content on the internet, at any time, for many different reasons. Therefore, all content on the internet should be accessibile to everybody, no matter what you situation is. Period!!! Again, we are all in this together because we are all drinking vital information and data from the same fountains, on the same internet.

This is a battleground for battle-tested warriors. If you want a quick overview of how big this problem really is just marinate on the idea of a movie about many battalions of web developers going thru 90% of all the websites on the planet. The goal of those armies of developers and designers is to update Web Accessibility best practices, on all those websites, to simply pass the basic requirements of WCAG-2, the Department of Justice, and the ADA.
