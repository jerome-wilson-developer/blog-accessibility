            <p style="font-weight:500; font-size:1.1rem;">
                First, let us discuss the basics of Web Accessibility and why the discussion of it continues to grow. The plain answer is that all internet content should be displayed in a way that allows everybody to be able to access and consume the content and then put it to work. When web designers/developers use Web Accessibility guidelines and best practices, it increases everybody's ability to access important information needed to manage their daily activities.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    Many accessibility problems start for companies when people using assistive technology are not able to work their equipment to get the expected results. That assistive equipment includes screen readers, special keyboards, mouth stick, head wand, single-switch access, sip and puff switch, oversized trackball mouse, special keyboards, eye-tracking, voice recognition software, etc.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Those companies are then vunerble to the ADA's Web Accessibility lawsuits. They can lose signicant amounts of money. 
                </p></li>
                <li>
                    A UK study, <a href="http://www.clickawaypound.com/cap16finalreport.html">Click-Away Pound Survey 2016</a> of 2000+ people states that 71% of users with disabilities said they chose to abandon difficult-to-use websites! The same survey revealed those customers who abandon the difficult-to-access websites represent a spending power of roughly $12,000,000,000.00 (billion) euros, and, 82% would spend more money if the websites were constructed with better web accessibility.  
            </ul>

In a split second, anything can happen to any one of us, at any time, to disable or handicap your ability to access vital and critical web content.

                This is the 1st blog post i am writing for an ongoing blog series called: "Let's talk Web Accessibility". This series is designed to be an investigative report and a tutorial about the evolving industry of web and apps accessibility. I intend to show that improving Web Accessibility improves use of the internet for all 7 billion people. Content that is digitally accessibile is currently being regulated by laws in many countries as the legal issues increase. Coincidentally, our audience of handicapped and disabled people includes a market of over 1 billion people, with over $6,000,000,000,000.00 (trillion) dollars in spending power ... ok ... hello ... did i just get your attention ??

                This blog post is my first article, of many to come, which will document the progress of the who, what, where, why and when this huge unprecedented problem will be resolved ..... or not resolved! This blog series is my way of addressing "a new and growing problem", inside, "the old information-digital-divide". This series is my humble attempt to become somewhat of an authority on an issue that sincerely humbles me.

            <p>On a daily basis, the disabled, the handicapped, and the 2nd tier of disabled people mentioned above encouter barriers when attempting to use the internet for basic services. Nowadays, it is simply routine internet use to search for services such as affordable housing, doctor appointments, paying bills, building online relationships, making online income, creating online income, etc. Poor and inadequate web access makes it harder to perform the activities necessary to escape impoverishment and marginalization.

            <p>Until it becomes a trend for businesses to make Web Accessibility a part of their strategic planning, our digitally-connected world will be a difficult place to navigate. Many high-performing, Fortune 100 companies are already making "Digital-inclusion" a part of their strategic planning.

                WebAIM did a survey of homepages for the top 1 million worldwide websites. It is discussed in the <span><a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">WebAIM Million report</a></span>. 97.8% of the home pages had detectable <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0">WCAG-2 failures</a></span>.
                5 of 6 pages were due to <span><a href="http://wiki.accede-web.com/en/notices/html-css">improper HTML code</a></span> for Accessibility. And to show you how bad the failure indicators really were, the automated tool used only detected a small portion of the actual accessibility issues.

                If 97.8% of the top 1 million hoe pages in teh WebAIM Million report (Feb2018) failed for basic and fundamental reasons, then i foresee Web Accessibiity becoming a peripheral industry around the web design business. Not only will "Web Accessibiity Support Companies" service coded websites (html, css, javascript, php, python, etc), but also wordpress, drupal, joomla, squrespace, wix, and others affected by ADA and WCAG regulations, laws, guidelines, and best practices. As those best practices and laws evolve, so will the need for continous updates.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe that is why the big guns (Facebook, Microsoft, Stanford, AT&T, LinkedIn, Georgia Tech, Adobe, and others) are coming out and uniting. Web Accessibiity will surely affect their individual profitability, Goodwill, and reputations as household names.

            A Summary of this Blog Post ... the 1st of many
        </h2>
        <p class="para-title">What have we learned about the world of Web Accessibility ?? ...</p>
        <p>In my humble opinion, the most important lesson from this blog post is that anyone and everyone can be crippled from consuming content on the internet, at any time, for many different reasons. Therefore, all content on the internet should be accessibile to everybody, no matter what you situation is. Period!!! Again, we are all in this together because we are all drinking our vital information and data from the same fountains on the same internet. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            Our next follow-up blog post for: "Let's talk Web Accessibility"
        </h2>
        <p class="para-title">What, specifically, can web developers/designers, businesses, WCAG-2, and the ADA do to eliminate the problems of Web Accessibility ?? ...</p>
        <p>Obviously, there are numerous moving parts and many proverbial cogs in the wheels of fixing this humongous problem! The faint of heart should not apply ... lol! This is a battleground for battle-tested warriors. If you want a quick overview of how big this problem really is, just marinate on the idea of a movie about many battalions of web developers going thru 90% of all the websites on the planet to update their Web Accessibility best practices to simply pass the basic standards of WCAG-2, the Department of Justice, and the ADA.

            Hopefully, you will join us in the next blog post to discover the solutions that we have to share. Once you read our solutions, we will need YOU to share you solutions and after-thoughts about how to solve this problem.
